# Soft-Robotics-Locomotion-Control

## Overview

This repository demonstrates a progression of control strategies for soft robotics actuation, moving from simple manual on-off control toward advanced methods that combine PID and LQR. It highlights how basic open-loop feedforward actuation can be extended into closed-loop feedback control frameworks that enable more precise and adaptive behavior.
