## Overview

This repository demonstrates a progression of control strategies for soft robotics actuation, moving from simple manual on-off control toward advanced methods that combine PID and LQR. It highlights how basic open-loop feedforward actuation can be extended into closed-loop feedback control frameworks that enable more precise and adaptive behavior.

## Prototyping

My soft robot prototype was fabricated using Ecoflex liquid silicone rubber, cast in custom 3D-printed molds designed in Autodesk Fusion. These molds define internal pneumatic channels, allowing the silicone body to bend and deform when pressurized.



The actuators were connected to a fluidic control board fitted with either an Arduino Mega for on-off control or a Raspberry Pi for PID and LQR control, together with solenoid valves, a power system, pneumatic sensors, and manual switches. This setup was assembled on a compact platform to enable testing with different control approaches.
